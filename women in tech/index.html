            Professional careers leap forward. New business opportunities arise</p>

            marketing professionals and writers, for example. If you opt for one of these positions in the tech sector,
             you will also have the unique opportunity to learn more about the technology we use every single day – and

                    <p class="card-text">Topping virtually every list of female tech CEOs is Susan Wojcicki. Google’s sixteenth employee and 
                        initial marketing manager, Wojcicki contributed to the development of Google Images and AdSense as she rose up the ranks. 
                        The Silicon Valley native and mother of five eventually suggested the acquisition of YouTube, and became its CEO in 2014.
                        “Tech is an incredible force that will change our world in ways we can’t anticipate. If that force is only 20 to 30% women, 
                        that is a problem,” Wojcicki has said. We love the bold stance she takes against gender discrimination in her op-ed pieces.”</p>

                    <p class="card-text">used her 401(k) to start Black Girls Code in 2011. The struggle to find a diverse 
                        computer programming course for her daughter in the Bay Area inspired the nonprofit, which now has the mission of teaching a million girls of color how to code by the year 2040.
                        Having studied electrical engineering in college, Bryant said, “I didn’t want my daughter to feel culturally isolated in the pursuit of her studies as 
                        I had as a young girl. 
                        I didn’t want her to give up on her passions just because she didn’t see anyone else like her in the classroom.”

                    <p class="card-text">Reshma Saujani is a New York Times bestselling author and the brains behind the famous TED Talk, 
                        “Teach girls bravery, not perfection.” The daughter of refugees graduated from Harvard University and Yale Law School. 
                        In 2010, she became the first Indian-American woman to run for Congress.
                        “When I lost, I wanted to continue to make a difference,” Saujani told Adweek.
                         “I figured the best way that I could do that is by creating opportunities for girls.” Two years later,
                          she started the nonprofit, 
                        Girls Who Code, aimed at increasing the number of women in the computer science field.</p>
